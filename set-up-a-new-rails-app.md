In a terminal window, navigate to your coding directory.
eg `cd coding/personal/`

If your app will be called, eg `sophie`, run:
- `suspenders sophie`

The suspenders script will install a fresh Rails app in a new `sophie` folder. When it's finished, run `ls` to see the new folder. Step into it with:
- `cd sophie`

Suspenders also initialized a Git repository. Make your initial commit:
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
