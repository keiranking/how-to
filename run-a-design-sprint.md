### 9:45 Write PDS schedule on Watson door

Expand the current day, collapse the rest.

### 10:00 Introduce people

- **Colonel Michael C. Malone**: wounded warrior undergoing treatment for a traumatic brain injury (TBI) at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
- **Keiran King**: product designer at thoughtbot
- **Eric Collins**: developer and director at thoughtbot

### 10:02 Introduce PDS

A sprint is an experiment.

Like all good experiments, a sprint has a hypothesis, and an explicit method for validating that hypothesis.

We are going to come up with the hypothesis now. The rest of the week is the method for validating it.

Why run an experiment? Why not just build your existing idea?

Because building a product is extremely risky. Most businesses, most products fail. [Half of all small businesses do not live to see their 3rd birthday]. That means even having great people and good intentions and many of the right ingredients is not enough.

To make your chance of success better than a coin toss, you need to remove some of the risk, the uncertainty. That's what the PDS is designed to do.

Problem: Most products fail
Solution: PDS to de-risk business and partially validate solution

The PDS itself is a well-validated solution to a well-defined problem.

This week, we will:
- Define a compelling problem
- Design a lean solution
- Start to validate the solution for product-market fit

On Friday evening, the most important deliverable you will have is knowledge. Knowledge about the viability of the path we choose to explore this week.

### 10:10 Goal & Questions

Why are we doing this? What's the big problem we're trying to solve?

- People with TBI can't do things they used to do before their injury.
- Caregivers for people with TBI spend most of their time doing so.

### 10:30 Questions, or How can we fail
- Can a mobile app help TBI patients live a life that is closer to the life they had before their injury?
- Can a mobile app significantly reduce the time it takes to care for someone with TBI on a daily basis?
- Will people with TBI find a mobile app helpful in their daily life?
